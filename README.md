This script calculates all the natural divisors of a given number and saves the output to the /var/log/messages file. It can be run with a command-line argument specifying the number, or by providing the number in a file called input.txt in the user's home directory.

Usage

To run the script with a command-line argument, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Then, run the following command:

Natural Divisors Calculator

./clinch.sh [number]
Replace [number] with the natural number for which you want to calculate the divisors.

To run the script using the input.txt file, first create a file called input.txt in your home directory (~/input.txt). Then, open the file and add the natural number you want to calculate the divisors for. Finally, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located, and run the following command:
./clinch.sh
The script will read the number from the input.txt file and calculate its divisors.

Automation

To run the script once when the system starts up, you can add the following line to your crontab file:

@reboot /path/to/script/clinch.sh [number] >> /var/log/messages &
Replace /path/to/script with the path to the directory where the script is located, and [number] with the natural number for which you want to calculate the divisors.

To run the script every hour, you can add the following line to the crontab file:

0 * * * * /path/to/script/clinch.sh [number] >> /var/log/messages
Replace /path/to/script with the path to the directory where the script is located, and [number] with the natural number for which you want to calculate the divisors.
